# LSPD Paperwork

This is a helper application for doing paperwork. It relies on a number of template files in order to function. You will need to retrieve them from the pre-built version on the LSPD internal forum if you want to use this yourself.

You are of course free to write your own templates instead and use it for your own purposes.
