This is a helper application for doing LSPD Paperwork on Eclipse RP. Templates are extracted automatically the first time you run the application.

You are of course free to write your own templates instead and use it for your own purposes.

When running for the first time, you will be prompted for your name, URL to an image of your signature and the reply URL for your Duty reports.
